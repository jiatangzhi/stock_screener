This final year project is undertaken with the ultimate aim to explore ways of automating the replication of correlated portfolios across shares with different algorithms and select one to implement into a visualization tool that will enable us to build our portfolio. The stock market dynamics provide an overview of the global economy that acts as a catalyst for stakeholders to participate in order to benefit different sectors financially, mainly by investing in companies that will reward them as well as the economy. These algorithms are evaluated and compared in order to make a well-educated decision on the essential core aims of my project. By the end I will decide whether the program can efficiently analyse the data available from Yahoo Finance in order to provide a quick overview of the financial market state from companies in the S&P 500 US stock prices. This paper will also discuss issues encountered and conclude by evaluating the project using the method I recognized as most effective and suitable.
